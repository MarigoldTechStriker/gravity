# Gravity

## What is this?
Gravity is a recreation of the hive's gravity. This project originally was gonna be for Beetonia but that sadly is no longer going on.

## Will this work?
Probably not. This is one of the first projects I've used FSMGasm (a state machine library by Minikloon) with, so I didn't really know how to properly use it yet which is why I used a modified version which is no longer up. There is also some rough code on the database end which might not work. I also used the dropper map for testing which is not included with this download.

## What would you do differently if you would release this right now?
First of all I would've used Gradle instead of Maven. I'm more familiar with buildtools now and I prefer gradle these days.
Secondly I would've used Kotlin instead of Java. After getting myself familiar with Kotlin about a year ago I massively prefer it over java and couldn't live without it.
Finally this project is somewhat organised but still messy. If I would've coded this today I would've used DI to make this less spaghetti code and way more readable overal.
